A function is like a machine in a code that execute (with or without input) and gives the user an output. 

The machine could have a list of input called arguments, while it can also work without. 

The parameters are the settings of the machine that may change functionality of the function to the user's desired mode. 

An if statement is a statement in lines of code that determines its conditions before executing the code inside its bracket. If the conditions turn out true, the code is executed.
